# chord_analysis
Input: Notes on a piano. Output: Possible chord names.
I have been playing music for a long time and recently I decided to learn some more jazz. The chord naming can be difficult and sometimes ambiguous. I've seen software that can take MIDI input and suggest chord names based on the input. I intend to try to make my own version of that software. The input will be given note by note by the user or via MIDI. The software will analyze the given set of notes (e.g. C E G A) and output possible interpretations of that chord as a chord name (e.g. C6 or Am7/C).
